# ICVFX

ICVFX R&D in Unreal Engine

## Setup

The Vicon Link Link plugin may require to be installed to the project Plugins folder (rather than the Engine plugins).

If Unreal Engine crashes on launch, this could be due to the Vicon Live Link plugin.
Disable this plugin in the uproject file and relaunch the project.
